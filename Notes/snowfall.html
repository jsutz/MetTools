    <h3>Precipitation Type:</h3>

        <h4>Precipitation types that are included in the measuring of snowfall amount:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>SN, SHSN, ... </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Showers (SHSN)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Typically produced by cumuliform cloud;</li>
            <li>Often, but not always, begins and ends abruptly - typically in short periods,
            however, can last for much longer - usually with rapid fluctuations in
            intensity;</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Continuous (SN)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Typically produced by stratiform cloud;</li>
            <li>Usually associated with the approach of a warm front;</li>
            <li>Can be both, continuous OR intermittent;</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Considered continuous if it continues without a break for at least one hour preceding
                the time of observation OR continues without a break since beginning within the hour
                preceding the observation;</li>
                <li>Precipitation that is not showery in nature is considered intermittent when it has
                stopped and recommenced at least once within the hour preceding the observation;</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h4>Intensity:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The intensity of snowfall SHALL be determined by visibility;</li>
            <li>This applies to: SN, SHSN, SG, GS, DZ, FZDZ;</li>
            <ul>
                <li>LGT : Visibility of 5/8 or more;</li>
                <li>MDT : If alone AND Visibility of 1/2 or 3/8;</li>
                <li>HVY : If alone AND visibility of 0, 1/8, or 1/4;</li>
            </ul>
            <li>* Alone: occurring with no other precipitation; OR any other obstructions to vision;</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Reporting Snowfall - Metars, Specials and Check Obs</h3>

        <h4>Snowfall Remarks:</h4>

        <p><strong>/Sss/ (Depth Of Newly Fallen Snow):</strong> MANOBS 10.2.19.9 to 10.2.19.9.3</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Depth of newly fallen snow, since the last main synoptic report;</li>
             <li>It is measured prior to the transmission of the METAR, only when snowfall is occurring,
            or has occurred within the hour preceding the METAR;</li>
            <li>It is taken from the approved weaver board, measured with the snow ruler and rounded to
            the nearest whole centimeter;</li>
            <li>/Sss/ SHALL be reported only when the rounded hourly value equals or exceeds 1cm;</li>
            <li>One half of the weaver board should be cleared each hour in which snow has fallen, while
            the other half should be cleared at each synoptic observation, when snow has fallen. This
            ensures accurate measurements are being taken at each hourly and synoptic observation.
            <li>Remember to keep in mind, melting and wind will effect this amount. If all of the newly
            fallen snow has melted by the time the METAR is taken, /Sss/ will be omitted;</li>
        </ul>

                within the current synoptic period, the amount SHALL be recorded as "TR";</li>

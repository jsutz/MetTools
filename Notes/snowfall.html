    <h3>Metars and Specials</h3>

    <h4>Type:</h4>

        <h5>Showers (SHSN)</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>produced by cumuliform cloud;</li>
            <li>often, but not always, begin and end abruptly, typically in short periods,
            however, can last for much longer, usually with rapid fluctuations in
            intensity;</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Continuous (SN)</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>produced by stratiform cloud, usually associated with the approach of a warm front;</li>
            <li>can be either continuous OR intermittent;</li>
            <li>considered continuous if it continues without a break for at least one hour preceding
            the time of observation, OR continues without a break since beginning within the hour
            preceding the observation;</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Intermittent</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>precipitation that is not showery in nature is considered intermittent when it has
            stopped and recommenced at least once within the hour preceding the observation;</li>
        </ul>

    <h4>Intensity:</h4>

        <p>Intensity SHALL be determined by visibility;</p>
        <p>Applicable to: SN, SHSN, SG, GS, DZ, FZDZ;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>LGT : Visibility of 5/8 or more;</li>
            <li>MDT : If alone AND Visibility of 1/2 or 3/8;</li>
            <li>HVY : If alone AND visibility of 0, 1/8, or 1/4;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>* Alone: occurring with no other precipitation;
        OR any other obstructions to vision;</p>

        <h4>Precipitation types recorded as snowfall amount:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>SN, SHSN, ... </li>
        </ul>

    <h4>Snowfall Remarks:</h4>

        <h5>/Sss/: MANOBS 10.2.19.9 to 10.2.19.9.3</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Accumulating depth of newly fallen snow, since the last main synoptic report,
            measured with a ruler, and taken from the ground and/or approved weaver board;</li>
            <li>Snow depth is checked at each METAR, and is rounded to the nearest whole
            centimeter;</li>
            <li>SHALL be reported only when the rounded accumulated value equals or exceeds 1cm,
            OR exceeds the previously reported value by 1cm or more;</li>
            <li>Melting and wind will effect this amount; If all of the snow melts by the time
            the METAR is taken, /Sss/ will be omitted;</li>
        </ul>

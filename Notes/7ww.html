    <h3>7wwW<sub>1</sub>W<sub>2</sub> Rules and Examples</h3>

    <h4>Rule 1: MANOBS 12.3.10 or 12.3.10.3.3 (1)</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>When no significant weather has been observed within the preceding
        synoptic period, this group will <strong>ALWAYS</strong> be omitted.</li>
        <li><strong>This rule never changes.</strong></li>
    </ul>


    <h4>Rule 2: MANOBS 12.3.10 or 12.3.10.3.3 (2)</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>When there is only one weather type, extending from the previous synoptic
        period and continuous throughout the current synoptic period, the codes for
        <strong>ww</strong>, <strong>W<sub>1</sub></strong>, and <strong>W<sub>2</sub></strong>
        will <strong>ALWAYS</strong> be coded as to represent the same weather type.</li>
        <li>I.e. 8088</li>
    </ul>


    <h4>Rule 3: MANOBS 12.3.10 or 12.3.10.3.3 (17)</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>When there is only one weather type, beginning some time during the current
        synoptic period and occurring at the time of observation, the codes for
        <strong>W<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>W<sub>2</sub></strong> will
        <strong>ALWAYS</strong> be coded the same as to represent the trend of the
        cloud throughout the current synoptic period.</li>
        <li>I.e. 8022</li>
    </ul>


    <h4>Rule 4: MANOBS 12.3.10 or 12.3.10.3.3 (12)</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>When there is only one weather type, extending from the previous synoptic
        period and stopping prior to the hour preceding the synoptic observation, the
        code for <strong>ww</strong> will <strong>ALWAYS</strong> be coded as to represent
        the cloud opacity at the time of observation; and, the codes for
        <strong>W<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>W<sub>2</sub></strong> will
        <strong>ALWAYS</strong> be coded as to represent the same weather type.</li>
        <li>I.e. 0288</li>
    </ul>


    <h4>Rule 5: MANOBS 12.3.10 or 12.3.10.3.3 (16)</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>When there is only one weather type, extending from the previous synoptic
        period and stopping within the hour preceding the synoptic observation, however,
        <strong>NOT</strong> occurring at the time of observation, the code for
        <strong>ww</strong> will <strong>ALWAYS</strong> be coded using codes 20-29; and,
        <strong>W<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>W<sub>2</sub></strong> will represent
        any further, different, significant weather; or, the trend of the cloud throughout
        the current synoptic period if no further significant weather was observed.</li>
        <li>I.e. 2522, 2582, 2586</li>
    </ul>


    <h4>Rule 6: MANOBS 12.3.10 or 12.3.10.3.3 (13)</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>It is crucial to <strong>ALWAYS</strong> be aware of any remarks transmitted
        throughout the current synoptic period as they may have an effect of the synoptic
        coding.</li>
        <li><strong>Certain remarks must be coded.</strong></li>
        <li>I.e. 1022, 1322</li>
    </ul>

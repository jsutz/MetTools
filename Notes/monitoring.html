    <h3>Observer Monitoring Standards</h3>

    <h4>Intention:</h4>

        <p>The intention of this document is to provide guidance for observers
        and to provide a training reference for those personnel tasked to monitor
        (or to perform quality control checks) of the Surface Weather Record
        (2322), and Observer's Notebook (2321).</p>

    <h4>Foreword:</h4>

        <p>It is up to the monitor to ensure that the work being inspected is done
        fairly, and in accordance with MANOBS and CFSMET. Anytime an error is
        assessed, include a reference from either MANOBS, MANAB, local SOP's, 1 CAD
        Directive, or CFSMET. The monitor SHALL sign column 69 of the Surface
        Weather Record, stating that he/she is responsible for the quality of the
        work checked. This includes the overall appearance and legibility of the
        sheet.</p>

    <h4>Checking The Observation Notebook (2321) - Hourlies/Specials/Check Obs</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>The Observers Notebook is the official document to that the Tactical
            Weather specialist observed during their shift and will be the benchmark
            for any other errors found on the 2322, or transmitted observations;</li>
            <li>All errors SHALL be underlined in red on the Notebook with a
            reference;</li>
            <li>The notebook will be broken down into the following errors:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Temperature (all numbers shown will be as written on the
                    2322);</li>
                    <li>Pressure (all numbers shown will be as written on the
                    2322);</li>
                    <li>Wind (all numbers shown will be as written on the
                    2322);</li>
                    <li>Visibility (all numbers shown will be as written on the
                    2322);</li>
                    <li>Atmospheric Phenomena (as shown on the 2322);</li>
                    <li>Clouds (as shown on the 2322);</li>
                    <li>Remarks (all "SHALL" remarks from MANOBS and CFSMET will
                    be included and MANAB will be used for these remarks when
                    possible);</li>
                    <li>Date and Time group, and the observers initials;</li>
                    <li>A checkmark, by the observer, beside each of the above to
                    note that they have validated their Ob with the 2322 and the
                    transmitted Ob;</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Temperature errors are given when:</li>

                    <li>A decimal and tenths are not included;</li>
                    <li>An obvious wrong temperature;</li>
                    <li>If manual calculations are done and there is one mistake
                    that leads to other temperature errors, only one temperature
                    error is given and the rest are recurring.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Pressure errors are given when:</li>
                <ul>

                    <li>If manual calculations are done and there is one mistake
                    that leads to other pressure errors, only one pressure error
                    is given and the rest are recurring.</li>
                    <li>The character of the three hour pressure change to be
                    within one of the following:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>No change (codes 0, 4, or 5);</li>
                            <li>Rise (codes 1, 2, or 3);</li>
                            <li>Fall (codes 6, 7, or 8);</li>
                        </ul>
                </ul>
            <li>Wind errors are given when not written down properly;</li>

                    <li>Precipitation that clearly cannot happen with the given
                    temperature;</li>
                    <li>No phenomena reported when visibility is 6sm or less;</li>
                    <li>Phenomena reported when visibility is 6sm or greater;</li>
                    <li>Missing additional, recent, or "in vicinity of" phenomena;</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Cloud errors are given when:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Not recorded properly;</li>
                    <li>Cloud is clearly in the wrong etage, or cloud is completely
                    wrong (leeway is to be given for stratus cloud, but it should
                    be below 1500Ft, although can go a little higher);</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Remarks errors are given when:</li>

                </ul>
            <li>Date and time group and initials errors will be given if any are

            <li>A validation error will be given if there are not a total of 8
            checkmarks, per page, on the 2321;</li>
            <li>Other possible errors:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>A clearly missed special is a validation error;</li>
                    <li>A clearly missed check ob, if the SOP's state one is to be
                    done when certain criteria are met, is a validation error;</li>
                    <li>An observer who willingly puts out more specials than is
                    required (i.e. to boost his/her monthly statistics), is a
                    validation error;</li>
                </ul>
            <li><strong>When monitoring, if an altimeter error, or any flight hazard
            is found, the monitor is to contact the supervisor immediately for
            further action.</strong></li>
        </ul>

    <h4>Checking The 2322</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>The Header:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ensure the header of the 2322 has been properly filled out with the
                    correct station name (i.e. TRENTON A, COMOX A), start and end date and time
                    groups, and the offset to GMT. Also note that if a second sheet is required,
                    all that us entered on this second sheet is the header, METAR's, SPECIAL's,
                    Check Ob's, and the Date in column 44 -- Nothing Else!</li>
                    <li><strong>One ENCODE error is given per 24 hours, to the member who
                    improperly fills out the Header.</strong></li>
                </ul>
        </ul>

    <h4>Historical Data For Mixed Manned and Auto Observations:</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>Ensure the previous day's data was transferred correctly. This data
            includes the following:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>0600Z Altimeter, placed at the top of column 39;</li>
                    <li>0600Z Station Pressure, placed at the top of the station
                    pressure column; along with the reduction to MSL to its left
                    at the edge of column 41 (example 10-15 in MANOBS);</li>
                    <li>0600Z dry bulb temperature, placed at the top of column 34;</li>
                    <li>The previous day's maximum temperature. Placed in column 6,
                    and written into the 1200Z synoptic observation (i.e. 1:TxTxTxTx);</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>

    <h4>Checking Observed Data:</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>Ensure all appropriate instrument remarks are recorded in column 1.
            <strong>One ENCODE error is given for each missed entry.</strong></li>
            <li>Ensure the weather timings in columns 2, 3, and 4 reflect what is
            entered in column 32. Also note that if columns 2, 3, and 4 have been
            filled up, it is to be continued in column 1. Do no use a second 2322 for
            continuing further. <strong>One ENCODE error is given for each incorrect
            entry;</strong></li>
            <li>Ensure that the 6 hour maximum and minimum temperatures in columns
            5 and 7 are entered correctly, and compared with the temperatures as
            recorded in column 34, and also with AMAUTO on the Briefer Workstation.
            Ensure that column s 6 and 8 are entered correctly. <strong>One ENCODE
            error given for each incorrect entry or a missed maximum or minimum
            temperature;</strong></li>
            <li>Ensure the precipitation data has been entered and totaled correctly.
            <strong>One ENCODE error given for each wrong entry in columns 9, 10, 11,
            12, 13 and 14;</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Columns 15 to 22 can only be given as ENCODE errors;</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Columns 23 to 43 can only be given as ENCODE errors due to the
            fact that the numbers were taken from the 2321;</strong></li>
        </ul>

    <h4>Checking Observed Data:</h4>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Any computed data that comes from columns 6 and 8, and from
            columns 9 through 14, will be considered VALIDATION errors, even if they
            received a previous error in the aforementioned columns;</strong></li>
            <li>Every main synoptic code group that has separate codes (i.e. 7ww, 8Nh,
            iRiXhVV, etc.) will be marked separately for each component of that group.
            In the case of some codes, that either included or exclude another group
            (i.e. iX for 7wwWW), if someone excludes the group, but there is clearly
            past weather, an "iX" error would be given, as well as a VALIDATION error
            for the 7ww group error. <strong>All errors found in the synoptic groups
            are ENCODE errors. You could possibly have both, a VALIDATION error and
            an ENCODE error, when it comes to temperature or precipitation synoptic
            groups;</strong></li>
            <li>Guidance is given in MANOBS for 7wwW<sub>1</sub>W<sub>2</sub>. If there
            is no guidance on a particular past weather scenario, benefit goes to the
            observer if the code still describes the weather;</li>
        </ul>

    <h4>Making Corrections:</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>Make corrections as legibly as possible;</li>
            <li>When data is found to be incorrect in columns 28 through 40 of an hourly
            observation, use a straight edge (or ruler) to cross out the incorrect data
            in red and print the correct data neatly above, also in red, the date of the
            hourly observation SHALL be circled in red, and an asterisk SHALL be printed
            in the bottom right-hand corner of the 2322;</li>
            <li>All other errors will be crossed out with a straight edge and corrected
            in red;</li>
            <li>Any illegible data shall be crossed out and re-entered neatly above, in
            black;</li>
            <li>Only one cross out per box is recommended, and for the sake of neatness or
            legibility, re-copying of the sheet may be required. <strong>There is to be a
            maximum of no more than six cross outs per each 24 hour period, otherwise the
            tech who made the most errors will re-write the sheet;</strong></li>
            <li>It is noted, for monitors and observers, the timings of when entries are
            corrected in red?:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Red is to be used following the next hourly observation or special;</li>
                    <li>Red is to be used after the 1 hour 15 minutes allotted for synoptic
                    observations;</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>

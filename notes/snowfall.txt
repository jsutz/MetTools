    Recording Snowfall
    ==================

        Metars and Specials
        -------------------

        Type:

            Showers (SHSN)  : produced by cumuliform cloud;
                            : often, but not always, begin and end abruptly,
                              typically in short periods, however, can last for
                              much longer, usually with rapid fluctuations in
                              intensity;

            Continuous (SN) : produced by stratiform cloud, usually associated
                              with the approach of a warm front;
                            : can be either continuous OR intermittent;
                            : considered continuous if it continues without a
                              break for at least one hour preceding the time of
                              observation, OR continues without a break since
                              beginning within the hour preceding the
                              observation;

            Intermittent    : precipitation that is not showery in nature is
                              considered intermittent when it has stopped and
                              recommenced at least once within the hour
                              preceding the observation;

        Intensity:

            Determined by visibility;
            Applicable to: SN, SHSN, SG, GS, DZ, FZDZ;

            -SN, -SHSN  : Visibility of 5/8 or more;
             SN,  SHSN  : If alone AND Visibility of 1/2 or 3/8;
            +SN, +SHSN  : If alone AND visibility of 0, 1/8, or 1/4;

                        * Alone: occurring with no other precipitation,
                          OR any other obstructions to vision;

        Snowfall Remarks:

            /Sss/   : MANOBS 10.2.19.9 (10.2.19.9.1 to 10.2.19.9.3)

                    : Accumulating depth of newly fallen snow, since the last
                      main synoptic report, measured with a ruler, and taken
                      from the ground and/or approved weaver board;
                    : Snow depth is checked at each METAR, and is rounded to
                      the nearest whole centimeter;
                    : SHALL be reported only when the rounded accumulated value
                      equals or exceeds 1cm, OR exceeds the previously reported
                      value by 1cm or more;

                    * Melting and wind will effect this amount;
                   ** If all of the snow melts by the time the METAR is taken,
                      /Sss/ will not be recorded;

        Synoptic Observations

                    : Snowfall amount, taken from the ground,
                      recorded in centimeters and tenths;
                    : When there is less than a measurable amount (> 0.2cm),
                      but snow occurred within the period, record as "TR";
                    : Record "0" for none;

            Col. 10 : MANOBS 13.3.9

                    * For stations without a snow gauge, the water-equivalent
                      amount SHALL be estimated (snow in cm / 10);
                        i.e. Snow   = 1.4cm

                      precipitation is on the surface;

                    : Depth of newly fallen snow, prior to any melting

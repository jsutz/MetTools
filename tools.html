      <h2>RtDc Calculator</h2>
      <p>The 909:RtDc Calculator tool was created to aid meteorological technicians with the calculation of Rt
      and Dc - the time at which precipitation began or ended and the duration of - at weather stations still
      recording synoptic observations.<br>
      Also, provided below for convenience, are the related Manobs references, along with a simple table for the manual
      calculation of Rt and Dc.</p>

      <p>This tool is to be used as an aid only, and it is highly recommended that the technician manually calculate
      the codes for Rt and Dc to ensure their correctness. That being said, the tool has undergone months of testing
      and operational usage and can be trusted to generate the correct codes. If, however, an error is encountered,
      please contact the site administrator withe details.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Select the appropriate synoptic period from the drop down menu provided.</li>
          <li>Select the number of periods of precipitation from the drop down menu provided.</li>
          <i>If only one period of precipitation occured within the previous 6 hours, select [1];
          If two or more periods of precipitation occured within the previous 6 hours, select [2].</i>
          <li>Enter the start and the end times into the text boxes provided.</li>
          <i>If the first period of precipitation began more than 24 hours prior to the synoptic
          period, check the box provided, otherwise, leave it unchecked.</i>
          <i>If two or more periods occured, enter the start and end times for the first period and
          last period of precipitation.</i>
          <i>If two or more periods occured, and the break between them is less than 15 minutes, the
          two periods will be combined and displayed as one period.</i>
          <li>When all required fields are entered, press [SUBMIT] to validate the input.</li>

    <p><b>12.4.11.3.3</b><br>
    Time of Precipitation Table: Rt - time at which precipitation, given by RRR,
    began or ended. This information shall be obtained from columns 3 and 4 and
    coded according to the following table: WMO Code 3552.</p>
    <p><b><i>Note (1): </i></b>
    If there is a choice, use the smaller code figure.
    For example: if rain ended exactly four hours ago, use code figure 4.</p>
    <p><b><i>Note (2): </i></b>
    When a station has not been continuously staffed and a recording
    rain gauge was not in operation throughout the period, it may be necessary
    to code Rt as 9.</p>
    <p><b><i>Note (3): </i></b>
    Rt shall be coded with reference to the official time of observation.
    When precipitation is occurring at the time of observation, Rt shall
    refer to the "time precipitation began." When precipitation is not
    occurring at the time of observation, Rt shall refer to the "time
    precipitation ended," except: 1) If the coding of ww indicates that
    precipitation has ended during the preceding hour (ww codes 20 - 27
    and 29), Rt shall be coded to indicate the "time precipitation began."
    2) When two or more periods of precipitation occur during a six -
    hour period preceding the observation, the time (beginning or ending)
    of the last period of precipitation shall be reported by Rt.
    Occurrences of precipitation shall be considered as separate periods
    of precipitation when separated by 15 minutes or more.</p>

    Duration and character of precipitation table: WMO code 0833.</p>
    <p><b><i>Note (1): </i></b>
    If there is a choice, use the smaller code figure. For example, if a
    single period of precipitation lasted exactly three hours, use code

    Occurrences of precipitation shall be considered as separate periods

    <p><b><i>Note (3): </i></b>
    If only one period of precipitation has occurred during the past six
    hours, and is still occurring at the time of observation, the
    duration is defined as the time elapsed from the beginning of
    precipitation until the time of observation. If precipitation is not
    occurring at the time of observation, the duration is the interval
    from beginning to end of the precipitation (See 12.3.10.3.3, examples
    2 to 5, 8, 9, 11, 13 to 16, and 18).</p>
    <p><b><i>Note (4): </i></b>
    If two or more periods of precipitation have occurred during the
    past six hours, and precipitation is occurring at the time of
    observation, the duration is defined as the time elapsed from the
    beginning of the first period of precipitation, all or part of which
    occurred during the past six hours, until the time of observation. If
    precipitation is not occurring at the time of observation, the
    duration is defined as the interval from the beginning of the first
    period of precipitation to the end of the last period of precipitation
    (See 12.3.10.3.3, examples 6, 7, and 10).</p>

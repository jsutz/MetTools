      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <p>1. Select the synoptic period from the drop down menu provided.</p>
      <p>2. Select the number of periods of precipitation from the drop down menu provided.</p>
      <p><i>Note:</i> If only one period of precipitation occured within the previous 6 hours, select [1];
        If two or more periods of precipitation occured within the previous 6 hours, select [2].</p>
      <p>3. Enter the start and the end times into the text boxes provided.</p>
      <p><i>Note:</i> If the first period of precipitation began more than 24 hours prior to the synoptic 
        period, check the box provided, otherwise, leave it unchecked.</p>
      <p><i>Note:</i> If two or more periods occured, enter the start and end times for the first period and 
        last period of precipitation.</p>
      <p><i>Note:</i> If two or more periods occured, and the break between them is less than 15 minutes, the 
        two periods will be combined and displayed as one period.</p>
      <p>4. When all fields are entered, press [submit] to validate the input.</p>
      <p><i>Note:</i> If no errors appear, the codes for Rt and Dc will be displayed at the bottom of the form.</p>
      <p><i>Note:</i> Pressing [clear] will refresh the form.</p>

      <p><b>12.4.11.3.3</b><br>
      Time of Precipitation Table: Rt - time at which precipitation, given by RRR,
      began or ended. This information shall be obtained from columns 3 and 4 and
      coded according to the following table: WMO Code 3552.</p>
      <p><b><i>Note (1): </i></b>
      If there is a choice, use the smaller code figure.
      For example: if rain ended exactly four hours ago, use code figure 4.</p>
      <p><b><i>Note (2): </i></b>
      When a station has not been continuously staffed and a recording
      rain gauge was not in operation throughout the period, it may be necessary
      to code Rt as 9.</p>
      <p><b><i>Note (3): </i></b>
      Rt shall be coded with reference to the official time of observation.
      When precipitation is occurring at the time of observation, Rt shall
      refer to the "time precipitation began." When precipitation is not
      occurring at the time of observation, Rt shall refer to the "time
      precipitation ended," except: 1) If the coding of ww indicates that
      precipitation has ended during the preceding hour (ww codes 20 - 27
      and 29), Rt shall be coded to indicate the "time precipitation began."
      2) When two or more periods of precipitation occur during a six -
      hour period preceding the observation, the time (beginning or ending)
      of the last period of precipitation shall be reported by Rt.
      Occurrences of precipitation shall be considered as separate periods
      of precipitation when separated by 15 minutes or more.</p>

      Duration and character of precipitation table: WMO code 0833.</p>
      <p><b><i>Note (1): </i></b>
      If there is a choice, use the smaller code figure. For example, if a
      single period of precipitation lasted exactly three hours, use code
      figure 1.</p>
      <p><b><i>Note (2): </i></b>
      Occurrences of precipitation shall be considered as separate periods
      of precipitation when separated by intervals of 15 minutes or more.</p>
      <p><b><i>Note (3): </i></b>
      If only one period of precipitation has occurred during the past six
      hours, and is still occurring at the time of observation, the
      duration is defined as the time elapsed from the beginning of
      precipitation until the time of observation. If precipitation is not
      occurring at the time of observation, the duration is the interval
      from beginning to end of the precipitation (See 12.3.10.3.3, examples
      2 to 5, 8, 9, 11, 13 to 16, and 18).</p>
      <p><b><i>Note (4): </i></b>
      If two or more periods of precipitation have occurred during the
      past six hours, and precipitation is occurring at the time of
      observation, the duration is defined as the time elapsed from the
      beginning of the first period of precipitation, all or part of which
      occurred during the past six hours, until the time of observation. If
      precipitation is not occurring at the time of observation, the
      duration is defined as the interval from the beginning of the first
      period of precipitation to the end of the last period of precipitation
      (See 12.3.10.3.3, examples 6, 7, and 10).</p>

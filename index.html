      <p>This tool was originally created to aid technicians with the
      calculation of Rt and Dc - the time at which precipitation, given by RRR,
      began or ended along with the duration and character - at weather stations
      still recording synoptic observations.</p>
      <p>This tool is to be used as an aid only and it is highly recommended
      that technicians still calculate Rt and Dc codes manually using the table
      provided in MANOBS and, for convenience, <a href=rtdc.html#references>here.</a>
      Manobs references are also provided <a href=rtdc.html#references>here</a>
      for convenience.</p>
      <p>The program has undergone months of testing and has been in operation for
      roughly six months without error. In the event an error is found, or if you
      have ideas to help make the program better, please report them to the creator
      of the site using the form provided.</p>

      <p>This tool was originally created to aid technicians with the 
      calculation of Rt and Dc - the time at which precipitation, given by RRR,
      began or ended along with the duration and character - at weather stations 
      still recording synoptic observations.</p>
      <p>This tool is to be used as an aid only and it is highly recommended 
      that technicians still calculate Rt and Dc codes manually using the table 
      provided in MANOBS and for convenience, <a href=calculator.html#manobs>here.</a></p>
      <p>On that note: the program has undergone months of testing and has been 
      in operation for roughly six months now without error.</p>
      <p>If any errors, or bugs are found or you have ideas to help make the 
      program better, please report them to the creator of the site using the 
      form provided at the bottom of the site.</p>

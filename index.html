                <h2>About This Site:</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                The Met resources site was launched in early 2017 and was originally created with the aim of
                providing a single repository of meteorological resources to aid technicians in their daily tasks.
                <br>
                The Resources page, provides a growing repository of url's for a wide range of meteorology
                resources, including: publications, research papers, journals, a number of national and international
                meteorological sites, along with, satellites, radars, cameras, aviation tools, and much more.
                <br>
                Along with a repository of url's, the Tools page, for now, provides only a single widget used
                for calculating 909:RtDc codes, along with a manual calculation table and the associated Manobs
                references. More tools will be added in the future.
                <br>
                This site is still undergoing construction and some features may not be fully functional at this time.
                If you encounter issues, please contact the site administrator with details.

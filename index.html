      <h2>About This Site:</h2>
      
      <p>
      The Met resources site was launched in early 2017 and was originally created with the aim of 
      providing a single repository of meteorological resources to aid technicians in their daily tasks.
      </p><p>
      The Resources page, provides a growing repository of url’s for a wide range of meteorology 
      resources, including: publications, research papers, journals, a number of national and international 
      meteorological sites, along with, satellites, radars, cameras, aviation tools, and much more.
      </p><p>
      Along with a repository of url’s, the Tools page, for now, provides only a single widget used 
      for calculating 909:RtDc codes, along with a manual calculation table and the associated Manobs 
      references. More tools will be added in the future.
      </p><p>
      This site is still undergoing construction and some features may not be fully functional at this time.
      If you encounter issues, please contact the site administrator with details.
